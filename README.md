# Gym Sign-up Web Scraper

This project stemmed from me having to manually sign up to the next gym class exactly a week before the class takes place. The reason for this was because the classes were fully booked very quickly (people do sign up at 12.30pm on the dot, a week before) so I needed something automated to do this for me. So I thought, why not do a bit of scraping and learn a bit about how [Pupeeter](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) works. Pupeeter is a tool which allows you to do end-to-end testing
